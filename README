NAME
  testy.rb

DESCRIPTION
  a minimalist BDD testing framework for ruby that's mad at the world and
  plans to kick it's ass by ruthlessly removing lines of testing framework
  code

SYNOPSIS
  Testy.testing 'your code' do
    test 'some behaviour' do |t|
      ultimate = Ultimate.new
      t.check :name, :expect => 42, :actual => ultimate.answer
    end
  end

  open http://github.com/ahoward/testy/tree/master
  git clone git://github.com/ahoward/testy.git

PRINCIPLES AND GOALS
  . it.should.not.merely.be.a.unit.testing.with.a.clever.dsl

  . testing should not require learning a framework.  ruby is a great
  framework so testy uses it instead, requiring programmers learn exactly 2
  new method calls

  . testing loc should not dwarf those of the application

  . testing framework loc should not dwarf those of the application

  . testing frameworks should *never* alter ruby built-ins nor add methods to
  Object, Kernel, .et al

  . the output of tests should be machine parsable for reporting and ci tools
  to easily integrate with

  . the output of tests should be beautiful so that humans can read it

  . the shape of the test file should not insult the programmer so that tests
  can double as sample code

  . the testing framework should never alter exception semantics

  . hi-jacking at_exit sucks ass

  . the exit status of running a test suite should indicate the degree of it's
  failure state (testy returns the percent of failed tests using a non-zero
  exit status)

  . sample code should easily be able to double as a test suite, including
  it's output

  . testing should improve your code and help your users, not make you want to
  kill yourself

  . using a format that aligns in terminal is sanity saving when comparing
  output

  . testing frameworks should provide as few shortcuts for making brittle
  tightly coupled tests as possible

  . test suites should be able to be created, manipulated, have their output
  streamed to different ports, and even tested themselves - they should be
  plain ol objects under the hood
  
SAMPLES

  <========< samples/a.rb >========>

  ~ > cat samples/a.rb

    # simple use of testy involves simply writing code, and recording the result
    # you expect against the actual result
    #
    # notice that the output is very pretty and that the exitstatus is 0 when all
    # tests pass
    #
      require 'testy'

          list << 42
          result.check :a, :expect => 42, :actual => list.first

    the kick-ass-ed-ness of testy: 
      the ultimate answer to life: 
        success:

    # testy will handle unexpected results and exceptions thrown in your code in
    # exactly the same way - by reporting on them in a beautiful fashion and
    # continuing to run other tests.  notice, however, that an unexpected result
    # or raised exception will cause a non-zero exitstatus (the percent of tests
    # that failed) for the suite as a whole.  also note that previously
    # accumulated expect/actual pairs are still reported on in the error report.

    # in some cases you may not even want to make test assertions and simply

    # can be run and running a single or multiple tests based on name or pattern.
    # notice that, when no assertions are made using 'result.check' the output of
    # the test becomes the expected *and* actual and is therefore shown in the
    # output as yaml.  of course, if your samples have errors they are reported in
    # the normal fashion and the tests will fail.
